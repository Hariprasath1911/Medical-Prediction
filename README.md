I'm excited to unveil my latest project: Medical Prediction Web App 🎉
This app is the culmination of extensive data cleaning and machine learning applied to three critical datasets: Kidney, Liver, and Parkinson's disease. 
By transforming raw data into powerful predictive models, I’ve built an intuitive Streamlit application that brings AI-driven medical predictions to the forefront.

💻 𝐓𝐞𝐜𝐡𝐧𝐨𝐥𝐨𝐠𝐢𝐞𝐬 𝐔𝐬𝐞𝐝:
🐍 Python – For robust backend logic.
📊 Streamlit – For a user-friendly and interactive interface.
🤖 Scikit-learn – To power accurate machine learning predictions.
➗ Numpy – For seamless numerical computations.
📦 Pickle – To save and load models efficiently.

🔍 𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐇𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐥𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬:
🛠 Comprehensive Data Cleaning: Ensured accuracy and reliability of three healthcare datasets.
🤖 AI-Driven Models: Leveraged cutting-edge algorithms for predictive analysis.
🌐 Interactive Web App: Designed for ease of use, enabling real-time predictions.
💡 This project represents my passion for integrating data science into healthcare to drive innovation and better outcomes.
